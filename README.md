- 👋 Hi, I’m @MasterCryptoEggs
- 👀 I’m interested in <b>Blockchain</b>
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to incubate alien eggs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on <b>Polygon Network</b>
- 📫 How to reach me <b>"Soon"</b>

✳️ What is Master CryptoEggs?
<blockquote>Master CryptoEggs (MCE) is an NFT set of 10,000 Alien Eggs at Polygon Network. This collection was forged by a complex algorithm to produce unique pieces for us.</blockquote>

✳️ Why Polygon network, not Ethereum?
<blockquote>There are many reasons for making this decision. The Gas Fees on Ethereum are too high, and the mint price will be high-priced for those who haven't had a chance before to mint an NFT and sell it on OpenSea.</blockquote>

✳️ How much do gas fees cost on Polygon Network?
<blockquote>The Gas fee in Polygon Network costs about 0.06 $MATIC, and you can check any transaction on (polygonscan.com/txs) to verify.</blockquote>

✳️ Will there be a whitelist for Presale?
<blockquote>No, but we have a MasterList for the Presale, We will select in total 2500 members to be in the MasterList to mint.</blockquote>

✳️ What is the mint price at the Presale?
<blockquote>There will be two batches for Presale, the first one will cost 5 $MATIC, and the batch size is 2000 NFTs. The second batch will cost you 15 $MATIC, and the batch size is 3000 NFTs.</blockquote>

✳️ What is the number allowed to mint?
<blockquote>To give as many a chance as possible to mint, we decided to set the number at 2 per wallet.</blockquote>

✳️ How much does it cost in Public Sale?
<blockquote>The price of the mint will cost 30 $MATIC. Once they sell out, you will be able to purchase them on OpenSea.io from our holders at a higher price.</blockquote>

<b>more information will be released with the official links soon as possible.</b>
